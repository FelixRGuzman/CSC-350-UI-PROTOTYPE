# CSC-350-UI-PROTOTYPE

As of now we are missing a couple of files that I haven't yet designed and didn't design in the original storyboard however, I made all the future or atleast most of the future links
clickable to show that it would lead to another html page. 

The goal would be to be able to insert and create service boxes as a logged in user that's also a freelancer, and as a normal user just click on those boxes. They will have a lot more detail.
The drawn storyboard shows it slightly better.

Overall though, this is the idea.
